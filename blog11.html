    <h3>Course Structure</h3>
    <p>
      I think the 3 projects work pretty well. I have heard that the course used to only be two projects: the static website and then the web service + client together? 
      If so, the split was a good change. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I liked the blog, I would keep that. It’s a good way to keep students brushed up on HTML/CSS after we move past it. I might narrow the focus sometimes, like 
      “This week write an entry about a React feature” and provide some resources for information. I easily fall victim to 
      the <a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/economics/the-paradox-of-choice/" target="_blank">paradox of choice</a> so 
      the complete open-endedness meant I was often spending more time looking for a topic to write about than I actually spent writing. Though I guess 
      I learned more that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      You mentioned wanting reading quizzes or checkpoints to keep students inclined to do the readings and follow along. I think I would adopt one of these 
      in my version of the class, especially as someone without too much self-motivation. Maybe the reading activities and the in-class labs could be combined 
      into the same assignment. Students could start the lab at home then come to class with problems and troubleshoot. Then they could turn in the assignment 
      for an actual grade, not just participation. But this might lead to students doing the whole thing at home and skipping class, so I’d have to think about it. 
      Another option would be a Tuesday lecture where I could walk students through the textbook examples followed by a Thursday lab that they’d complete on 
      their own. The drawback here is that there might not be enough time to get through everything with only one lecture and lab a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I’d continue with the no-exams decision. They would just cause unnecessary stress when there’s nothing else you can really test students on that they 
      wouldn’t already be able to prove proficiency in through the projects.
    </p>

    <h3>Course Content</h3>
    <p>
      The difficulty of the course felt off balance when comparing the HTML/CSS side and the JS/React side. The latter half was much more difficult, at least for me. 
      I feel like I’ve got a nice grasp on what HTML and CSS have to offer, but I imagine there’s still much we didn’t get to with JS/React. This probably can’t 
      be helped given the nature of the languages and I don’t really have a solution for this, but I felt like pointing it out anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don’t really know the differences between React vs. Angular vs. Vue so I’d just go with your judgement and teach React.
    </p>
    <p>
      I liked the textbook a lot. It was direct and guided you through examples, and still incentivized you to follow along on your own machine instead of just 
      blankly reading through it. I’d definitely ask to borrow it if I was preparing to teach this course.
