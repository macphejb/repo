    <h1>Blog Entry #2</h1>
    <h2>9/9/2021</h2>

    <p>For this week's entry, I wanted to learn about embedding videos in HTML.</a></p>
    <p>
        YouTube seems to really encourage embedding videos in other sites. When you click the share button below a video,
        the first option is to embed. It is even listed before copying the link or sharing to a different social media platform.
        This makes the process incredibly easy as YouTube will provide a premade code sample:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9YffrCViTVk" title="YouTube video player" 
            frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
            allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>
    <p>Put into practice, it looks like this (this is the tutorial I watched to learn all this):</p>
    
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9YffrCViTVk" title="YouTube video player" 
    frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
    allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>
        I still had one question, though. Is this totally legal? Can anybody rip anyone else's YouTube video and put it on their 
        website without asking? A quick Google search led to 
        <a href="https://www.thesitewizard.com/general/copyright-issues.shtml" target="_blank">this write-up.</a>
        Under the Berne Convention all original artistic works are copyrighted the moment they are created whether the owner 
        asserts it or not. If you want to use a picture, video, music clip, etc. on your public site 100% legally, 
        perfect practice would have you obtain a license from the copyright holder. Of course, this is rarely the way the
        internet actually operates. The unwritten rule is: if you don't want people embedding your videos, turn off the
        aforementioned embed link. Since you can turn off or on the ability to embed a video, it is implied that leaving it
        on means you are fine with others embedding the vid. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For tech-savvy content creators (like the tutorial channel I used above), this should be fine. But, not everyone knows about the 
        embed toggle or what it does. The article mentions a Reddit post of someone getting sued for embedding a video on their site. 
        Even though the video creator let the video be embedded, they were seeking hundreds of thousands from a random blogger who
        did just that. At the time of writing, there was no verdict as to whether the case would be thrown out or not. I dug around a bit 
        and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8hhcgg/being_sued_170k_for_embedding_a_youtube_video/" target="_blank">found the post.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        They were being offered a $170k settlement but threatened for $700k if this deal wasn't taken. Most of the internet-lawyers 
        seemed to think there was no case and that the poster was within their rights. Unfortunately, the poster never left an 
        update as to what happened. But I think the lack of follow-up probably indicates everything worked out. Either way, it's 
        a bit scary that something as innocent as displaying a YouTube video on your website could have you contacting lawyers or worse.
