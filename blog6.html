    <h2>Cursors</h2>

    <p>
      A common theme in my blog entires, this post was inspired by a random sighting out on the web. I was on Reddit, and noticed that whenever I visited a particular
      subreddit (can't remember which) my cursor would change from its default white arrow. I guess moderators of some subreddits have CSS permissions on their pages.

    </p>

    <p>
      Naturally, I decided to investigate how I could do this myself.

      The code couldn't be simpler. You just set the cursor attribute to an image sourced by url or file-path. It will only show up in whatever field you apply this 
      tag. You'll notice that I have it in the margins, which I accomplished by first setting a custom cursor page-wide then overriding it in the body to the default cursor.
      The image choice was arbitrary, just one I had lying around.
    </p>

    <script language="Javascript">
      function example_change_cursor() {
        document.body.style.cursor = document.getElementById('example-cursor').options[document.getElementById('example-cursor').selectedIndex].value;
      }
      function example_restore_cursor() {
        document.body.style.cursor = 'default';
      }
    </script>
    <select id="example-cursor">
      <option>default</option>
      <option>crosshair</option>
      <option>help</option>
      <option>move</option>
      <option>not-allowed</option>
      <option>pointer</option>
      <option>progress</option>
      <option>text</option>
      <option>wait</option>
    </select>
    <input type="button" onclick="example_change_cursor()" value="Change Cursor" />
    <input type="button" onclick="example_restore_cursor()" value="Restore Default" />

    <p>
      For something a little more complex, here is a tool that can dynamically change the cursor to some of the system-wide options. It takes advantage of the same CSS field shown above
      but uses JS to switch between cursors.

      There is a reason the custom cursor trend that died out in the 2000s. They can just be annoying, especially if they are page-wide. And actually having to click links and highlight text is made 
      unnecessarily hard. Still, this was a useful skill to have picked up. Now if I want to have a movable component on my site, for example, I'll be able to make it intuitive to the user by
      invoking the moving cursor style.
