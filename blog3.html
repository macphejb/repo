    <h1>Blog Entry #3</h1>
    <h2>9/16/2021</h2>

    <svg viewBox="0 0 500 150" class = "shapetext">
        <path id="curve" d="M6,150C49.63,93,105.79,36.65,156.2,47.55,207.89,58.74,213,131.91,264,150c40.67,14.43,108.57-6.91,229-145" />
        <text x="25">
          <textPath xlink:href="#curve">
            Wacky shaped text!
          </textPath>
        </text>
      </svg>

    <p>I came across an example of some text wrapped around a circle and thought I'd see if I could replicate it.</p>

    <p>
        I was brought to  <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/svg/curved-text-along-path/" target="_blank">this site,</a> which seems to be a compilation of interesting user-submitted
        CSS techniques. I may return for future blog post inspiration. Anyways, I was met with this snippet when I opened the article:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
    &lt;svg viewBox="0 0 500 500"&gt;
        &lt;path id="curve" d="M73.2,148.6c4-6.1,65.5-96.8,178.6-95.6c111.3,1.2,170.8,90.3,175.1,97" /&gt;
        &lt;text width="500"&gt;
            &lt;textPath alignment-baseline="top" xlink:href="#curve"&gt;
                Dangerous Curves Ahead
            &lt;/textPath&gt;
        &lt;/text&gt;
    &lt;/svg&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        I was a bit taken aback, it looked pretty daunting. My eyes were drawn to the seemingly nonsense string of numbers and characters. But, I was determined to figure it out.
        I started with the first tag. The article mentions SVG though it never explained what it was. After googling I found it stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and can be used to
        make 2d graphics within HTML. That was the key to shaping the text. Basically, you draw a shape in SVG, hide that shape, then use textPath to curve text around the invisible shape.
        The string of characters I noticed were instructions on how the curve is drawn. This one is pretty specific so I'm guessing the curve was drawn out by hand then converted
        to the path format. It ends up looking like a sine wave.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only step from there was to make a circular path to wrap my text around. I took one from Stack Overflow, modified the above code replacing the path, and I had my circle text!
    </p>

    <svg viewBox="0 0 500 200" class = "opener">
        <path id="circle" d="
        M 100, 100
        m -75, 0
        a 75,75 0 1,1 150,0
        a 75,75 0 1,1 -150,0
        " />
        <text x="40">
          <textPath xlink:href="#circle">
            Wacky shaped text in a circle!
          </textPath>
        </text>
    </svg>
